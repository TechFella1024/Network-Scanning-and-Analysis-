# Basic Network Scanning and Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use Nmap to scan a local network and Wireshark to analyze network traffic. The goal is to identify open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities while learning to capture and analyze network packets.

## Tools Used
- [Nmap](https://nmap.org) for network scanning.
- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) for traffic analysis.

## Steps
1. Installed and configured Nmap and Wireshark on macOS.
2. Scanned the local network to identify active devices and services.
3. Captured and analyzed network traffic during the scan.

## Results
- **Nmap Scan**:
  - Identified open ports and running services on active devices.
  - Exported results: [Nmap Scan Results](https://github.com/TechFella1024/NmapScanResults)

- **Wireshark Traffic Analysis**:
  - Captured Nmap scan traffic.
  - Exported capture: [Nmap Traffic Capture](https://github.com/TechFella1024/Network-Scanning-and-Analysis-/blob/main/nmap_scan_traffic.pcap)

## Lessons Learned
- Learned how to perform detailed network scans using Nmap.
- Gained insights into how Nmap traffic appears in network captures.
- Understood how to analyze traffic for potential vulnerabilities.
